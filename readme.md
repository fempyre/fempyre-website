# so, i tried to make a website...

## after what feels like the 20th attempt, i’m giving up.

i just can’t do it. it doesn’t stick in my head. i’m too dumb to make this work, and i’ve painfully tried using chatgpt, but that didn’t help at all—just wasted hours of my time.

### what i tried:
- **frontend**: used astro
- **backend**: wanted to use strapi for a small blog

nothing but errors, errors, and more errors, and chatgpt wasn’t much help with any of it. i even searched for thousands of pdf guides on:
- website creation
- javascript
- astro

i compiled them to make my own gpt and spent **20 bucks** on a plus subscription, but this thing is still dumb as hell.

### the final straw:
i wanted to push everything i had done so far here and see if anyone would take the time and effort to help me out. but of course, chatgpt gave me some crap advice again, and all my work—hours of frustration—was overwritten by old files in seconds. now it's gone. all of it. **gone.**

### now, i’m just done.

i’ve been browsing some webrings and came across sites like:

- [maria.town](https://maria.town/)
- [pastelhello](https://pastelhello.com/)
- [ericchi.moe](https://www.ericchi.moe/)

## reflections
i love the design of these sites, that nostalgia that makes you feel like you’re back in the 2000s-2010s.

i wanted something like that, something personal. but to cut it short, i can’t do anything. i can’t develop, i can’t draw or make any artwork, and i didn’t even think about what my website should look like in the end because i’m probably the least creative person on earth.

i even bought a domain and a vps. but it’s all crap.

i’ll probably just redirect my domain to this page or some bullshit site, maybe even a cool webring.

yesterday was my birthday, and i spent the whole day working on this damn website, only to be left with nothing.

## contact
i have depression and maybe adhd or something along those lines. i’m at a kind of absolute low point and just want to sleep. i’ll probably do that. it’s already 00:27 here in germany.

if anyone wants to reach out to me, my email is leoniac@pm.me, and my discord is le0niac.

## final thoughts
peace out. definitely check out the sites i mentioned above; the creators put a lot of effort into them, and they’re really beautiful and informative. cya.
